# Trig
Trig.js is a simple and lightweight way to take more control of your animations with simple data attributes. Trig.js requires jQuery.

# How Does It Work?
The basic function of Trig.js is to add an "trig" class to your element when it becomes visible when scrolling. Allowing you to add a CSS animation for when that element has the "trig" class. The "trig" class is removed when the element is then off screen. This will then retrigger your CSS animation every time your element appears back on screen.

Trig.js will also create a CSS variable With the position of the elment. This allows you to move elements with CSS transform. Allowing you to easily make website animations that are interactive.
